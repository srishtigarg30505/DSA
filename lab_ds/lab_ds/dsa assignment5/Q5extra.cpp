// 5. Find the intersection node of two singly linked lists that merge into a Y-shaped structure.
// The lists may vary in length and have distinct nodes at the beginning, but from the point of
// intersection onward, they share the same sequence of nodes. The task is to identify the first
// common node where the two lists converge. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all,
// return null.

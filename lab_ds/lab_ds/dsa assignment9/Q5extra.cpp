// 5. Graph Traversal Count
// Given an undirected graph G(V, E) with V representing the number of vertices numbered from 0 to
// V-1 and E representing the number of edges, what is the task? Each edge connects two vertices u
// and v.

// Task: Determine the number of connected components in the graph.
// Input format: V E followed by E lines of (u v) pairs.
// Example:
// Input: V=5, E=3, edges=[[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
// Output: 2
